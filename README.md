# UUID

A simple UUID library and data type for Carp, conforming to RFC ...

## Usage

You’ll be able to pull in the library using:

```clojure
(load "git@github.com:carpentry-org/uuid@0.0.1")
```

You’ll then have access to two functions, `UUID.generate` and `UUID.str`.
`generate` creates a new UUID, `str` transforms it into a human-readable
format, as defined in RFC ...

Have fun!
